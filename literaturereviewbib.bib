  abstract = {Simulation is a key technology for developing planning and exploratory models to optimize decision making as well as the design and operations of complex and smart production systems. It could also aid companies to evaluate the risks, costs, implementation barriers, impact on operational performance, and roadmap toward Industry 4.0. Although several advances have been made in this domain, studies that systematically characterize and analyze the development of simulation-based research in Industry 4.0 are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the state-of-the-art research performed on the intersecting area of simulation and the field of Industry 4.0. Initially, a conceptual framework describing Industry 4.0 in terms of enabling technologies and design principles for modeling and simulation of Industry 4.0 scenarios is proposed. Thereafter, literature on simulation technologies and Industry 4.0 design principles is systematically reviewed using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology. This study reveals an increasing trend in the number of publications on simulation in Industry 4.0 within the last four years. In total, 10 simulation-based approaches and 17 Industry 4.0 design principles were identified. A cross-analysis of concepts and evaluation of models’ development suggest that simulation can capture the design principles of Industry 4.0 and support the investigation of the Industry 4.0 phenomenon from different perspectives. Finally, the results of this study indicate hybrid simulation and digital twin as the primary simulation-based approaches in the context of Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {Digital twins are being adopted by increasingly more industries, transforming them and bringing new opportunities. Digital twins provide previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies. Recently, agriculture has seen several technological advancements, but it is still unclear if this community is making an effort to adopt digital twins in its operations. In this work, we employ a mixed-method approach to investigate the added-value of digital twins for agriculture. We examine the extent of digital twin adoption in agriculture, shed light on the concept and the benefits it brings, and provide an application-based roadmap for a more extended adoption. We report a literature review of digital twins in agriculture, covering years 2017-2020. We identify 28 use cases, and compare them with use cases in other disciplines. We compare reported benefits, service categories, and technology readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture. We distill the digital twin characteristics that can provide added-value to agriculture from the examined digital twin applications in agriculture and in other disciplines. Then, inspired by digital twin applications in other disciplines, we propose a roadmap for digital twins in agriculture, consisting of examples of growing complexity. We conclude this paper by identifying the distinctive characteristics of agricultural digital twins.}

    Cost-effective on-demand computing resources can help to process the increasing number of large, diverse datasets generated from smart internet-enabled technology, such as sensors, CCTV cameras, and mobile devices, with high temporal resolution. Category 1 emergency services (Ambulance, Fire and Rescue, and Police) can benefit from access to (near) real-time traffic- and weather data to coordinate multiple services, such as reassessing a route on the transport network affected by flooding or road incidents. However, there is a tendency not to utilise available smart city data sources, due to the heterogeneous data landscape, lack of real-time information, and communication inefficiencies. Using a systems engineering approach, we identify the current challenges faced by stakeholders involved in incident response and formulate future requirements for an improved system. Based on these initial findings, we develop a use case using Microsoft Azure cloud computing technology for analytical functionalities that can better support stakeholders in their response to an incident. Our prototype allows stakeholders to view available resources, send automatic updates and integrate location-based real-time weather and traffic data. We anticipate our study will provide a foundation for the future design of a data ontology for multi-agency incident response in smart cities of the future.

    abstract = "{there are around 100,000 new stroke cases and over a million people living with its consequences annually in the UK. This has large impacts on health and social care, unpaid carers and lost productivity. We aimed to estimate associated costs.we estimated 2014/2015 annual mean cost per person and aggregate UK cost of stroke for individuals aged ≥40 from a societal perspective. Health and social care costs in the first and subsequent years after stroke were estimated from discrete event simulation modelling, with probability of progression and length of receipt of different health and social care services obtained from routine registry and audit data. Unpaid care hours and lost productivity were obtained from trial data. UK unit costs were applied to estimate mean costs. Epidemiological estimates of stroke incidence and prevalence were then applied to estimate aggregate costs for the UK.mean cost of new-onset stroke is £45,409 (95\\% CI 42,054-48,763) in the first year after stroke and £24,778 (20,234–29,322) in subsequent years. Aggregate societal cost of stroke is £26 billion per year, including £8.6 billion for NHS and social care. The largest component of total cost was unpaid care (61\\%) and, given high survival, £20.6 billion related to ongoing care.the estimated aggregate cost of stroke substantially exceeds previous UK estimates. Since most of the cost is attributed to unpaid care, interventions aimed at rehabilitation and reducing new and recurrent stroke are likely to yield substantial benefits to carers and cost savings to society.}",
